--- ToDo ------------------------------------------------------------
* Make bootable does not work (WriteSDCard address wrong?)
* "Debug Parameters -> Create card with two partitions" does cause shutdown (WriteSDCard address wrong?)
* PTP doesn't support mode switching (otherwise works very good with ptpcam)
* tweak Color Palette (CAM_BITMAP_PALETTE), CHDK OSD Colors does not fit and are different in playback/record mode
* Check Propcase, at least one Propcase has changed (maybe it time for propcase4.h)
* os.remove() does delete files but fail to delete directory (like SX210, G11 and other new cameras too), tested with llibtst.lua
* Video Bitrate Override does not work (only Video Quality Override does work)

* Edge Overlay does not show correctly
* Histogram works, but Color Palette does not have required colors for correct display
* Zebra does not work (shows some shatterd pixel with left offset)

* RAW files are unreadable, but with "dummy" badpixel.bin DNG is readable but has some weird colored pixels all over the place
* badpixel.lua cause camera shutdown

* test "shoot_full" & "shoot_half" commands behave like they should

* probably more stuff to fix
